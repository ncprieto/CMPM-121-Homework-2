Homework 2

My scene features a low-poly version of a rock climbing wall that would be
typically found indoors at a rock climbing gym. I was inspired by professional
rock climbers that compete at international tournaments that are hosted around
the world. I was specifically inspired by a competition that happened recently
and the highlights from this competition can be found at this link

The route I recreated for my scene can be found at around 16:46. My scene features
a climbing wall, a few climbing holds and volumes, a person climbing the wall, a
chalk bag, a brush, and some protectives mats. The main character within the scene
would be the person climbing.
